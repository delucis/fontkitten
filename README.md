Fontkitten is a font data library based on the [fontkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fontkit) package. It offers a subset of fontkitâ€™s functionality, focusing on font file parsing and metadata extraction, and aims to be a lightweight alternative for projects that do not require the full feature set of fontkit.
